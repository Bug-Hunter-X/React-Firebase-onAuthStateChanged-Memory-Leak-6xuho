The issue arises when using Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener in conjunction with a React component's lifecycle methods, specifically `componentWillUnmount`.  The listener might not detach properly, leading to memory leaks or unexpected behavior after the component is unmounted.  This often happens because the unsubscribe function returned by `onAuthStateChanged` isn't called consistently or at the right time.  Consider this example:

```javascript
import { onAuthStateChanged } from 'firebase/auth';
import { auth } from './firebase'; // Your Firebase configuration

class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.unsubscribe = null; 
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.unsubscribe = onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
      // Update component state based on user authentication
      this.setState({ user });
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    if (this.unsubscribe) {
      this.unsubscribe();
    }
  }

  render() {
    // ... your JSX ...
  }
}
export default MyComponent; 
```

In this code, `componentWillUnmount` attempts to clean up, but in some scenarios, it might not be called or might be called too late.
